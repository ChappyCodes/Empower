            <h4><i>October 27, 1956 to August 19, 2014.</i></h4>
            <p> <strong> Only a few people knew the selfless trait of Ameyo Adadevoh, until she paid the supreme price in 
                order  to save millions of Nigerians contracting the deadly Ebola virus imported into the country
                by a  Liberian Patrick Sawyer who came to Nigeria for a conference. </strong></p>
        </div>

            <h1>How she achieved this:</h1>
            <p>
                Dr. Ameyo Stella Adadevoh curbed a wider spread of the Western African Ebola virus epidemic 
                in Nigeria  by placing the patient zero,
                Patrick Sawyer, in quarantine despite pressure from the Liberian government.
            </p>
                <p>
             As if Patrick Sawyer was deliberately trying to spread the ebola virus to top conference attendees,
             Dr Adadevoh resisted him from escaping from the isolation room he was confined in and was quoted as 
             saying, “for the greater public good”.

             Through her efforts, the Nigerian index case was limited playing a key role in curbing the spread
             of the virus in Nigeria.

            <h1>When did Ameyo Adadevoh test positive for Ebola virus?</h1>
            <p>
                While she tried to reduce the spread rate, she tested positive to the deadly virus on August 4, 2014.

                And on the afternoon of August 19, 2014, she died.

               After that, she went for the mandatory one-year housemanship at Lagos University Teaching Hospital 
               in 1981 and spent her residency at Lagos University Teaching Hospital, and obtained her 
               West African College of Physicians and Surgeons credential in 1983.

            <h1>Adadevoh’s effort in fighting against Ebola Virus:</h1>
            <p>
                Her effort prevented Patrick Sawyer from spreading the ebola virus across Nigeria in 2014.

                Operations Center.</p>
            <p>
                A few months after Adadevoh’s death, 
                the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Nigeria to be Ebola-free on October 20, 2014.
            </p>
            <i>Adadevoh’s life and achievement are testimony to the incomparable impact and contribution
                to what a woman of such intellect, selflessness and scientific vision can make in
                 saving lives.
